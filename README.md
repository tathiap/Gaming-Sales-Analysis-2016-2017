# Identifying Success Patterns in Video Game Sales for Advertising Campaign Planning

In this project, the goal is to analyze data from the online store Ice, which sells video games globally. The dataset includes information on user and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g., Xbox or PlayStation), historical data on game sales, and the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) ratings. The task is to uncover patterns that can help determine the success of video games, aiding in the identification of potential blockbuster titles and the planning of effective advertising campaigns.

The analysis covers data from 2016, with the scenario set in December 2016 as the team plans a campaign for 2017. The specific focus is on gaining valuable experience in working with data, and the time frame for forecasting sales is not strictly constrained to the year under consideration.
